Bounding statistical risk of a predictor\\\
Design a learning algorithm that predict with small statistical risk\\
$$
(D,\ell) \qquad \ell_d(h) = \barra{E}\left[ \, \ell (y), h(x) \, \right]
$$
were $D$ is unknown
$$
\ell(y, \hat{y}) \in [0,1] \quad \forall y, \hat{y} \in Y
$$
We cannot compute statistical risk of all predictor.\\
We assume statistical loss is bounded so between 0 and 1. Not true for all
losses (like logarithmic ).\\
Before design a learning algorithm with lowest risk, How can we estimate
risk?\\
We can use test error $\rightarrow$ way to measure performances of a predictor h.
We want to link test error and risk.
\\
Test set $S' = \{ (x'_1, y'_1) ...(x'_n,y'_n) \}$ is a random sample from $D$
\\
How can we use this assumption?\\
Go back to the definition of test error\\
\\
\red{ Sample mean (IT: Media campionaria)}\\
$$
\hat{\ell}_s(h) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{n} \ell (\hat{y}_t,h(x'_t))
$$
i can look at this as a random variable
\col{$\ell(y'_t,h(x'_t))$}{Blue}
\\
$$
\barra{E} \left[ \, \ell (y'_t, h(x'_t)) \right] = \ell_D(h) \longrightarrow \red{risk}
$$
